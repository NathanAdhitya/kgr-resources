    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>I've heard about this baby boy<br/>Who's come to earth to bring us joy<br/>And I just want to sing this song to you<br/>It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth<br/>The minor fall, the major lift<br/>With every breath I'm singing Hallelujah<br/>Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>A couple came to Bethlehem<br/>Expecting child, they searched the inn<br/>To find a place for You were coming soon<br/>And there was no room for them to stay<br/>So in a manger filled with hay<br/>God's only Son was born, oh Hallelujah<br/>Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1c">
      <lines>The shepherds left their flocks by night<br/>To see this baby wrapped in light<br/>A host of angels led them all to You<br/>It was just as the angels said<br/>You'll find Him in a manger bed<br/>Immanuel and Savior, Hallelujah<br/>Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1d">
      <lines>A star shown bright up in the east<br/>To Bethlehem, the wisemen three<br/>Came many miles and journeyed long for You<br/>And to the place at which You were<br/>Their frankincense and gold and myrrh<br/>They gave to You and cried out Hallelujah<br/>Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1e">
      <lines>I know You came to rescue me<br/>This baby boy would grow to be<br/>A man and one day die for me and you<br/>My sins would drive the nails in You<br/>That rugged cross was my cross, too<br/>Still every breath You drew was Hallelujah<br/>Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1f">
