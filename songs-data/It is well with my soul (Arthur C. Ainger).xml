    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>When peace like a river attendeth my way<br/>When sorrows like sea billows roll<br/>Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say<br/>It is well, it is well with my soul</lines>

    <verse name="v1c">
      <lines>Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come<br/>Let this blest assurance control<br/>That Christ (yes, He has) has regarded my helpless estate<br/>And has shed His own blood for my soul</lines>

    <verse name="v1e">
      <lines>My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought (a thought)<br/>My sin, not in part, but the whole (every bit, every bit, all of it)<br/>Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more (yes!)<br/>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!</lines>

      <lines>And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight<br/>The clouds be rolled back as a scroll<br/>The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend<br/>Even so, it is well with my soul!</lines>
