      <lines>God is good all the time<br/>He put a song of praise in this heart of mine<br/>God is good all the time<br/>Through the darkest night, His light will shine<br/>God is good, God is good all the time</lines>

    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>If you're walking through the valley<br/>And there are shadows all around<br/>Do not fear, He will guide you<br/>He will keep you safe and sound<br/>He has promised to never leave you</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1c">
      <lines>Nor forsake you, and His word is true</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1d">
      <lines>We were sinners and so unworthy<br/>Still for us He chose to die<br/>Filled us with His Holy Spirit, now we can stand and testify<br/>That His love is everlasting<br/>And His mercies, they will never end</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1e">
      <lines>Though I may not understand all the plans you have for me<br/>My life is in your hands and through the eyes of faith<br/>I can clearly see</lines>
